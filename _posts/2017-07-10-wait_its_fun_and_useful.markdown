My answer to the question of "Why did I decide to learn software development?" has both a highly honorable and less honorable answer. To start things off slightly dishonorably, I will say that I love the thought of learning today's arguably most valuable skill in the professional world. In school, I've always favored math and science classes and consider myself a "problem solving" type of student. Because of that natural tendency, I took a couple CS courses in high school and really like them.

I knew coming out of high school that I wanted to study computer science in college. During my freshman year at Brigham Young University in 2014-2015, I took the first two courses within the CS department. I'm now back at school after taking a 2 year break to serve as a missionary for the LDS church in Belgium and the Netherlands. I'm still continuing my studies in computer science in college and wanted to supplement the good theory and algorithmic though process taught in computer science at a good university with learning today's most commonly used programming languages through the Flatiron School. I guess you could say that by following the Online Web Developer program through Flatiron, I'm trying to put myself on a kind of 'coding fast-track' and get ahead of the game. ('ahead of the game' is, of course, a relative term as some programming wizards out there have been building personal computers from the age of 5) 

To speak a little bit to the 'dishonor' of my desire to code, I can't say that I want to spend the rest of my programming. Life does, of course, sometimes through us for a loop and change our plans without our permission, but as of now, I one day want to work on the business side of technology companies. Knowing how to code, or at least being technically literate, is essentially priceless in the business world today. So there you have it, I'm a coding imposter. For all you know, I could be hiding a dress shirt and suit underneath my graphic t-shirt and jeans that I wear to work.

However, in all honesty, I love coding! I loved it when I did it in high school, in college, and so far through the Flatiron School!  There aren't too many things out there that are both fun and useful, but lucky for me, you guys teach one of them! The Flatiron School may be just the jumpstart I need towards a career of both embracing and disguising my inner nerd.
